# opencv-biicode

Biicode hooks for opencv, both 2.4 and 3.0 beta. Thus, the source code is not actually stored in biicode, but the binaries or source code are retrieved from their original source and built as usual.

[OpenCV 2.4.10](http://www.biicode.com/diego/opencv)

[OpenCV 3.0 beta](http://www.biicode.com/diego/diego/opencv/beta)

These hooks allow an easy getting started in major platforms (tested in Win with VS, Ubuntu 14.04, OSX).

You can check the [examples here](http://www.biicode.com/diego/opencvex)

To contribute or feedback, this is [the github repo](https://github.com/drodri/opencv-biicode)
